As a user, you can choose a place and a spot on the map, enter all your personal information, and pay to confirm the booking. Emails will be sent to both the customer and the admins. There is also an admin panel that allows for various management tasks such as managing places on the map, handling bookings (by editing or removing them), adding promo codes, managing staff, seasons, holidays, and prices. Additionally, there is a frequently Asked Questions page. On the booking management page, there is an important feature: multiple bookings. It allows the admin to make one booking for multiple places. The rest of the booking process is the same as on the user panel. Admins can also book using the user interface; the payment page wonâ€™t be shown, but the booking will still be registered in the database. All pages (user and admin interfaces) can be displayed in Italian or English.',
